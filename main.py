Be thorough in your discussions, giving each participant equal chances to contribute to the discussion. The script should be mind stimulating, eye opening, fun to listen to and understandable to your audience. Also your podcast participants should pose questions where necessary among themselves or to the listeners. Dont make the podcast too formal. The scripts should have a clear start and ending, do not prematurely end discussions in the middle. The conversations should also be coherent and flow logically. The mood of the title should dictate the mood of the script. Use real names for the participants. Make sure that the script flows. Include the participants reactions e.g [laughs], [sighs], [music], [gasps], [clears throat]. Also add indicators to where music or sounds should be played. Ensure you add music or sounds to the podcast script. For the sounds or music add descriptions to what you want the music to be. use CAPITALIZATION for emphasis of a word. If there is any music to be played make the conversation to flow to it in a clean way.
                          

            Building blocks for a podcast
            ------------------------------------------------
            Intro üëã
                A podcast intro sets the stage for the rest of the show. It is important to get right. Also, audiences are pretty used to host‚Äôs reading a script during this part so you really can write it out if you want.

                Here are the sub-sections of an intro in a podcast script template:

            Intro Music üéµ
                If you use different intro music for each episode, you may want to list which song you plan on using. If you are using a mixer and playing the song live during your introduction, you definitely want to have the song chosen ahead of time. Even if you are just going to add the song in post production while editing, it can help to list the intro song in the podcast script just so you have that info in an easy to find place.

            Podcast Title and Tag Line/Short Description üî¶
                This is the first thing you say in your episode, every episode. Write it out for reliability, but after a few episodes even your audience will know it by heart. Listeners love this!

            Roadmap üó∫Ô∏è
                In terms of podcasts, a roadmap is where you want to list the main points what you are going to cover in that episode. You do not need to go in-depth, just give a brief outline so your audience does not feel like they are flying blind.

            Guest Intro ü§ù
                This is the segment meant to hype your listeners up about your guest. List off their relevant achievements, what they are currently doing, and how they tie into what your podcast is about.

                Now is not the time to list their social media handles or do any call to action on their part. That will be in the outro.

            Topics üìÇ
                You can think of a topic like a section. If you think you only have one topic, break that topic down into more narrow topics.

                For example, let‚Äôs say you are going to talk about the fresh water shortage in Hawaii. Break that down into multiple, digestible topics: 1) History of fresh water usage in Hawaii 2) What has caused the current shortage 3) What needs to be done to fix the problem.

                Under each topic, list the main points you want to hit and the supporting data you want to share.

                If you are interviewing a guest, each interview question can act as a topic.

            Sponsor Message ü§ë
                Make that money, honey!

                If you have a deal to do a host-read ad for a company, you can put the text you are supposed to read on your podcasts here.

                If you are going to bake in a separately produced advertisement for in post production, just make sure to leave a natural break here.

                Even if you do not have any current promotion contracts, still structure your episode as if you do. In the future you may get a contract and then you can dynamically insert ads into your old episodes.

            Segue ‚ÜîÔ∏è
                Not to be confused with a Segway. You do not need a helmet for this one.

                A segue is the connector between sections. There might need to be a segue between topics, or maybe a segue between a topic and an ad.

                Coming up with a segue on the spot during recording is a great way to stick your foot in your mouth. You may connect two things in a way that is offensive or you may ramble way off course, losing your listeners.

                Consider writing out your segues in full. At the very least, put in a few keywords so you remember how you want to make the transition.

            Recap ü§†
                Like a roadmap, a recap can help your listeners better comprehend the content of your episode and put their brains at ease. It does not need to summarize everything you have talked about, but giving some kind of wrap-up and closure is helpful.

            Outro üëã
                The outro is the long goodbye from you to your audience. But not too long! It is a way for you to send them on their way to feel positive feelings about your show.

                There are a few sub-sections of an outro in a podcast script template:

            Thank Co-Host or Guest üôå
                Showing your co-host or guest some love and gratitude at the end of the episode helps you build your podcast community. It is a sure way to end the episode on a good note, no matter how tough the material you covered in the episode was. Plus, it is just good manners.

            Call to Action (CTA) üôè
                This is where you ask your listeners to do something. If you have a guest, usually you list a call to action item or two for them as well.

                Common calls to action are to:
                -------------------------------
                    1. Follow and like the podcast on whatever listening platform that people are using (Apple, Spotify, etc.)
                    2. Share the podcast with friends and on social media
                    3. Visit the podcast‚Äôs website and follow their social media pages (including YouTube if you do video episodes)
                    4. Donate to help fund the show
                    5. Sign up for the podcast newsletter
                    6. Register for an in-person event the podcast is putting on
                          
            Next Episode üòé
                Preview what your next episode is going to be about. Let your listeners know when they can expect it to be released. Pump it up a little so they are excited and intrigued.

            Credits üéûÔ∏è
                Just like at the end of a movie, you may want to include credits in the outro. It may be something as simple as a quick thank you to someone who gave you the idea of the podcast topic. If you pulled heavily from published resources for you content, you probably want to list them here as well as in your episode notes. And of course if you are lucky enough to have a full team producers, editors, sound designers, etc then here is the place to give them a shout out.
